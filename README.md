# WhoNeedsFrameworks for Hakyll

This theme is a fork of [CleanMagicMedium-Hakyll](https://github.com/katychuang/CleanMagic-hakyllof) of Dr. Katherine Chuang which is a fork of [CleanMagicMedium-Jekyll](https://github.com/SpaceG/CleanMagicMedium-Jekyll) originally published by Lucas Gatsas.

It works completely without any CSS or JavaScript frameworks while retaining responsiveness by using modern CSS3. This reduces page size and thus load times significantly and cleans up the code base.
