I'm a software developer / researcher / data scientist based in Munich interested in human-computer interaction, machine learning, functional programming, data visualization and mixed reality.  

&nbsp;

Currently, I'm studying computer science (M.Sc.) at [LMU Munich](https://www.en.uni-muenchen.de/index.html). Previously, I've completed my bachelor of Media Informatics at LMU Munich, writing my bachelor thesis at [Lancaster University](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/) about Interaction in VR.  

&nbsp;

I've [co-written papers](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=ZHmZq24AAAAJ&hl=en) about gaze- and gesture interaction in VR ([SUI 2017](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3132180), [IEEE VR 2019](http://ieeevr.org/2019/program/papers.html)) and worked at [Intel Mobile Communications](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/wireless-network/5g-technology-overview.html), [Siemens AG](https://www.plm.automation.siemens.com/global/en/products/collaboration/mbse-model-based-systems-engineering.html) and [LMU Munich](https://www.medien.ifi.lmu.de/).  

&nbsp;

Additionally I've [co-written a popular article featured on instructables.com](https://www.instructables.com/id/NFC-Timeline-Radio/)  about building a NFC timeline radio.  

&nbsp;

Presently I'm working as a Research Assistant at the [Usable Security and Privacy group of Bundeswehr University](https://www.unibw.de/usable-security-and-privacy/) in Munich and am responsible for the BehaVR lab, along with supervision on topics ranging from VR/AR to gaze interaction, motion tracking and machine learning.
